#Satnav

##A micro (~1.5kb gzipped) JS routing library.

**Author:** *Joe Harlow* (<joe@f5.io>)

---
`Satnav` provides functionality for Regex-like paths in JavaScript. It is library agnostic and has no dependencies.

###Browser Support
---

`Satnav` is built on the `hashchange` event but also includes support for HTML5 `pushState`.

`Satnav` provides a built-in `hashchange` polyfill for older versions of browsers, however it is currently untested.

`Satnav` will work in the following browsers, plus most mobile browsers.

- Microsoft Internet Explorer 8+
- Mozilla Firefox 3.6+
- Google Chrome 5.0+
- Apple Safari 5.0+
- Opera 10.6+

###Installation
---

`Satnav` can be installed with `bower`, by running:

`bower install satnav`

###Usage
---

`Satnav` can be accessed using either `Satnav` or `sN`. From here on out, we will refer to it as `Satnav`.

####`Satnav`(`config /* Object */`)

`Satnav` itself is a function object. Calling `Satnav`(`config`) will set the global variables and return itself to enable chaining of functionality.

The `config` object can have the following properties:

- #####`html5` (`boolean`)
	Tells `Satnav` to use the HTML5 `pushState` method. Will only work if `pushState` is available.
	
	Default: `false`.
- #####`force` (`boolean`)
	Should a `hashchange` be forced again if it is the same route. Useful if you have a Single Page Website where the user could scroll away from that routes content.
	
	Default: `false`.
- #####`poll` (`int`)
	Interval in ms at which the `hashchange` polyfill should occur.
	
	Default: `25`.

#####Example

    Satnav({
	    html5: true, // use HTML5 pushState
	    force: true, // force change event on same route
	    poll: 100 // poll hash every 100ms if polyfilled
    });



###Methods (chainable)
---

####`navigate`(`route /* Object */`)

Used to define a route that `Satnav` should respond to. The `route` object should contain a `path` and `directions` property.

- #####`path` (`String`)

	A regex-like string containing the route. Parenthesised tokens in the string will become properties in the route's `params` object, and a value will be required for the route to be matched. Preceding a parenthesised token with a `?` will make the token optional. For eg. `'some/path/{required}/?{optional}'` will match `#some/path/value1` and `#some/path/value1/value2`, but not `#some/path`.

- #####`directions` (`Function`)

	A function callback for when the route is achieved. A `params` object will be passed into the function containing the token/values from the route.

#####Example

    Satnav.navigate({
    	path: 'some/path/{required}/?{optional}',
    	directions: function(params) {
    		console.log(params.required); // log value of 'required' token  
    		console.log(params.hasOwnProperty('optional')); // check if optional token exists      
    	}
    });

####`otherwise`(`route /* Object OR String * /`)

Used to define the default route that `Satnav` should target if no matching route is found.
route can either be a string or an object with a property of `path`.

#####Example

    Satnav.otherwise('/'); // will route all unmatched paths to #/
    
or

    Satnav.otherwise({
    	path: '/some/path/value1'
    });

####`change`(`fn /* Function */`)

A function callback fired on `hashchange`. **This function will be fired before a routes `directions` are fired**.

The function will receive a `params` object containing the token/values of the new route along with another object containing the previous `hashchange` token/values.

#####Example

    Satnav.change(function(params,old) {
    	console.log(params); // log new route values
    	console.log(old); // log previous route values
    });



####`go`()

Called at the end of a chain, `go`() tells `Satnav` to resolve the current route. This is what makes deeplinking possible.

#####Example

    Satnav({
		    html5: false, // don't use pushState
		    force: true, // force change event on same route
		    poll: 100 // poll hash every 100ms if polyfilled
    	})
    	.navigate({
    		path: 'some/path/{required}/?{optional}',
    		directions: function(params) {
    			console.log(params.required); // log value of 'required' token  
    			console.log(params.hasOwnProperty('optional')); // check if optional token exists      
    		}
    	})
    	.navigate({
    		path: 'another/path/?{optional}',
    		directions: function(params) {  
    			console.log(params.hasOwnProperty('optional')); // check if optional token exists      
    		}
    	})
    	.otherwise('/') // will route all unmatched paths to #/
    	.change(function(params,old) {
    		console.log(params); // log new route values
    		console.log(old); // log previous route values
    	})
    	.go()
    

###Deferring Hash Changes
---

`Satnav` includes the ability to defer a routes `directions`. This is extremely useful in builds where an animation off is required to happen before something else animates on for the new route.

####How-to

By returning `Satnav.defer` or `this.defer` in the `change` callback, `Satnav` will wait until the promise is resolved until continuing to the `directions` of the new route.

    Satnav
    	.navigate({
    		path: 'some/path/{required}/?{optional}',
    		directions: function(params) {
    			console.log('Fires 4 seconds after change callback');
    		}
    	})
    	.change(function(params,old) {
    		console.log('Change callback');
    		setTimeout(function() {
    			Satnav.resolve(); // we resolve Satnav 4 seconds after the change event is fired
    		}, 4000)
    		return this.defer; // return promise object
    	})
    	.go();
